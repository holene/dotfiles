What happens where webpro dotfiles:

line without # is a file
line with # is description
indentation implies the current file executes a file that needs to be described

install.sh
  # set dotfiles directories
  # add ./bin to path
    dotfiles file
      # defining functions
      # sub_help: prints out which functions are available, just for user help. 
    is-executable: checks if argument file is executable (type code --> code is /usr/local/bin/code)
    is-macos: check if we're on a mac
    is-supported: checks for number of arguments, then evaluates if argument is 1 or more. 
    json: aner ikke. Helt serr, wtf er greia med denne?
    plistbuddy: 4 arguments. function simplifying using plistbuddy
    set-config: 3 arguments. creates a file, writes some shit to the file. Used after running e.g. brew.sh
  # updating dotfiles repo
  # setting symlinks. This replaces existing .sh files. 
  # from 
    .bash_profile.sh
      # double checking script and folder paths
      # adding ./bin/ to path, again
      # reading .cache.sh if it exists
      # running each dotfile in the list, if they exist and are files: ./system/*
        function
          # do I really need all this with zsh?
          prepend-path() if I'm to use .path
        function_*
          # need: mk(), 
          # not needed: _fs, _network, _text, _osx
        path
          # I don't think I need this... 
          # Dependency: prepend-path from .functions
        env
          # 
        alias
          # 
        completion
        grep
        prompt
        nvb
        rvm
        custom
      # if the repo is run on macos run macos specific dotfiles. Which we won't distinguish on my installation
        env.macos
        alias.macos
        function.macos
    inputrc
      # doesn't exist on my old mac. Don't think I need it here either, then
    gitconfig, gitignore_global
      # git specific stuff. Not very densly populated on old machine
  # installing managers and pacages
  # running tests (no idea why). 
  # installing extra dotfiles repo if you add it. Not relecant.
