## Introduction 

Use at own risk! Don't clone this shit, fork and review it before playing. /br

## What's going on?

Workflow: 
* `install.sh` 
* runs `install/...`, sets up stuff such as `npm`, `git` and `git cask`
* runs `system/...`


Sets iTerm
Installs
* Brew
* Brew cask

// Todo: setup automatic documentation of applications from `install/...` to readme.md
